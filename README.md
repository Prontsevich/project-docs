# Prontsevich Skills

Agent skills for planning, executing, and documenting changes in software
projects. They work in Claude Code, Codex, and other harnesses that support the
Agent Skills format.

## Skills

- [change](skills/change/SKILL.md): understand a requested change, investigate
  code and docs, and prepare the smallest implementation-ready approach.
- [execute-tasks](skills/execute-tasks/SKILL.md): execute an approved plan in
  bounded steps with independent review, verification, and documentation closure.
- [project-docs](skills/project-docs/SKILL.md): set up, audit, and maintain
  project documentation with one authoritative home per fact.
- [setup-tracker](skills/setup-tracker/SKILL.md): run once per repository to
  write `docs/agents/tracker.md`, which maps work-tracking roles and operations
  to Linear, Plane, ClickUp, local Markdown, or another tracker. User-invoked
  only.

The skills form one flow, `change` → `execute-tasks` → `project-docs`, and each
also works on its own.

`change` and `execute-tasks` currently assume Linear for work tracking; moving
them onto the tracker adapter is the next step.

## Install

### Claude Code

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add Prontsevich/prontsevich-skills
claude plugin install prontsevich-skills@prontsevich
```

### Codex

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add Prontsevich/prontsevich-skills
codex plugin add prontsevich-skills@prontsevich
```

### Other agents

Copy a folder from `skills/` into the agent's skill directory. The entrypoint
of each skill is its `SKILL.md`.

## Development

Clone the repository and run `scripts/link-skills.sh` to symlink every skill
into `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.codex/skills`. A `git pull` then updates the
linked skills. Set `SKILL_LINK_DESTS` to link into other directories. The script
leaves an existing real directory in place and reports it.

Maintenance rules for this repository are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
